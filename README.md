# Create par2 in a different location

The whole purpose is to create par2 files in a location that is different
from the original data file.

# Call par2 on links

- create a link in a predefined way/location
- call par2 on that link to build par2 files
- remove the link

# Parameters

- input dir
- output dir
- input dir part to delete. The rest is created in the output dir.

# Example

`par2_dir /usr/export/vol01/users/dept01 /mnt/home /usr/export/vol01/users -- par2 c -r5`

It creates the output path that starts with the following: `/mnt/home/dept01`
And it calls the command that is passed as the rest of arguments (in this case
it's `par2 c -r5`) using the current link as the last parameter for this command.
The whole command looks like this:
`par2 c -r5 /mnt/home/dept01/some_file.dat`
